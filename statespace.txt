This directory is to start work on state space solutions to transonic flow problems and eventually utilise some machine learning algorithms to update flow fields.

First we need to establish a simple transonic flow solution with a state space formulation.

Second, we will combine this solution with a simple structural model to create an aeroelastic solution.

Third, we will try to update using machine learning.
